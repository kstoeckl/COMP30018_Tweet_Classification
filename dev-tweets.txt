1921951 11143751    Hi everyone, this is a changelog for the sunlightlabs API   W
1921951 11144861    NEW API METHOD: from user-request added people.sens.getSensFromState.php i.e. get the IDs of senators from a given state.   W
1921951 11148131    modified the JSON output of all API methods to be JSON standards-compliant: now both names and values are quoted    W
1921951 11233911    wow, so our API is being used in the capitol hill (east patio) region of Second Life    W
1921951 12600151    Fixed a bug with the At-Large states (AK,DE,MT,ND,SD,VT,WY) for people.reps.getRepFromDistrict.php. Will now accept &district=At-Large  W
1921951 17841571    Fixed bug in people.convertID if fromcode or tocode == entity_id and removed redundancy in output when fromcode == tocode   W
1921951 17950201    people.getDataItem now returns "O: no data" correctly rather than "NULL"    W
1921951 17953491    people.getDataCondition can now handle complex, &-containing URLs as input. See http://sunlightlabs.com/api/info.changelog.php  W
1921951 20282541    created new API method to provide better zip5s -> districts data: places.109th.getDistrictsFromZip5 W
1921951 37173792    microformats, yeah! Created new API method: people.getHCard. Get an hCard for every member of congress! W
